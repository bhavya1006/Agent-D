# Agent D Dashboard

## Overview

Agent D is a modern, responsive dashboard application designed to visualize and manage agent performance, execution timelines, recent activities, and tool usage. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui, it provides a clean and intuitive interface for monitoring and interacting with data.

## Project Goals

- Deliver a user-friendly dashboard for agent and tool management
- Visualize key metrics and activities in real-time
- Support extensibility for new components and data sources
- Ensure high performance and accessibility

## Key Features

- Agent performance tracking
- Execution timeline visualization
- Recent activity feed
- Tool usage analytics
- Sidebar navigation and header controls
- Modular UI components (cards, charts, tables, etc.)

## Tech Stack

Agent D uses the following technologies:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui

## Example Usage

Here is a conceptual overview of the Agent D dashboard layout:

```
------------------------------------------------------
| Sidebar |         Main Dashboard Panel              |
|---------|------------------------------------------|
| Agents  |  [Agent Performance Chart]                |
| Tools   |  [Execution Timeline]                    |
| Activity|  [Recent Activity Table]                  |
| ...     |  [Tool Usage Analytics]                   |
------------------------------------------------------
```

- **Sidebar**: Navigate between dashboard sections (Agents, Tools, Activity, etc.)
- **Main Panel**: Visualizes agent performance, execution timelines, recent activities, and tool usage.
- **Cards/Tables/Charts**: Summarize key metrics and statuses for quick insights.

### Example: Agent Performance Table

| Agent Name | Status | Tasks Completed | Last Active        |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Agent A    | Active | 120             | 2025-09-03 10:15AM |
| Agent B    | Idle   | 98              | 2025-09-03 09:50AM |
| Agent C    | Error  | 45              | 2025-09-03 08:30AM |

This table helps users quickly assess which agents are performing well, which are idle, and which may need attention.

### Example: Tool Usage Chart (Conceptual)

```
Tool Usage (Bar Chart)

Tool X | ██████████████ 80 uses
Tool Y | ████████       40 uses
Tool Z | ████           15 uses
```

This conceptual chart shows which tools are most frequently used, helping teams optimize resources and identify popular or underutilized tools.

These examples illustrate how Agent D helps users quickly understand system status and performance at a glance.
